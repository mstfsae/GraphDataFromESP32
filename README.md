# GraphDataFromESP32
This graphs data from an esp32 

In order to get this to work your laptop has to be connected to the esp32 server

# Purpose
Right now on the esp32 side it generates random values, but it can be changed to read data
from different sensors. Once we have that functionality, this can be used to view the data
from the dash in real time.
